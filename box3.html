<p><b><font face="Arial" size="6">Connecting via a Landline</font></b><br>
<p><font face="Arial" size="4">Connecting via a Landline is much simpler than the DreamPi method, however it requires a real Landline and isn't as stable as DreamPi due to the nature of modern phone networks.</p>
<p>To begin connecting via a Landline, make sure your WebTV box is trying to dial toll free, instead of dialing a local number.
You can check by unplugging your WebTV box, then plugging it back in. When you turn it back on, it might ask if you've moved. Tell it that you have, and it'll begin to dial.
If the box is already dialing toll free, you don't need to do anything.<p>

<p>That's it! Thanks to an incredibly generous donation by webcd, connecting to WebTV Redialed via a landline is essentially plug and play.<br><br>
